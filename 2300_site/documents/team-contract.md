## Contract Terms

**Your group contract/working agreement should include these elements. Feel free to add other terms, too.**

1. To what goals do we all commit?

We commit to completing the website milestones on time and have a full, polished website.
Having a physical meeting at least once for the larger milestones.


2. What are our “ground rules”? (Don't make an exhaustive list—stick with just a few.)

We will get tasks done before each milestone. If one of us can't do the expected work before then, make sure to give teammates notice ahead of time.
Also, our milestones will be fully done to the best of our abilities so that we do not have to make amendments after moving on from the milestone.

3. By what means and how frequently will we meet or communicate?

We commit to meating once a week, and checking WhatsApp routinely.


4. How will we communicate and work with our client?

Separate group chat for client
Through email correspondence which we will all be 'CC'ed to

5. What roles will we create? Include a description of exactly what each role is responsible for.

Potential roles would include project lead, design lead, prgramming lead.
Project lead will be responsible for time management, client liasion, and making sure the team is on track for finishing the website.
The design lead is the UX/UI expert. They are the person who will help drive the website to best suit the needs of the client's target audience.
Programming lead will be the technical expert in fixing php and sql errors.
Another person will be the intermediary between design and programming who's focus is in making sure the end product is seamless.

6. How will we hold ourselves and one another accountable? What (exactly) will we say to a team member who appears not to be contributing equally? To a team member who fails to deliver what was promised?

If one team member isn't putting in the same amount of work, they will be messaged and/or spoken to in person about their level of commitment. If a team member fails to deliver their work on time without ample notice, they will be expected to explain themself at the next meeting.
There will be honest, but respectful communication on our responsibilites and the expectation that slacking off will not be forgiven in evaluvations.

7. What do we do when we disagree? What approach to conflict to we all agree to uphold?

We will uphold what the majority of the group agrees upon. If there is a equal split, it will be up to the person who's job it was to complete task at issue.

8. What are our procedures for re-visiting this contract?

We will update contract as needed, if we decide another way of working is better.

10. What else do we want to include in this contract? (Think about a *fun* clause... not everything is always about work! Sometimes you need to celebrate your accomplishments!)

We will make sure to be nice and friendly thorughout the duration of this project's compeltion. :)
Potentially grab boba before/after meetings!

## How to Use This Contract

You are expected to follow your team contract. If you are having issues (e.g. conflicts) in your team, the first thing you should do is follow the contract. If the contract isn't working, then your team should revise it.

If you cannot resolve your issue using the contract, you may reach out to the instructor via the <info2300-prof@cornell.edu> email. Be advised, that the first thing the instructor will ask you is, "did you try to resolve your issue with the contract?" The next question the instructor will ask you is, "what change did you make to your contract to resolve the issue?"
